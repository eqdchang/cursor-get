1. Logo (links to home)
2. Login — `/en-us/home/login/`
3. Investors — `https://investors.solventum.com/` (external, new tab)

6. Contact us — `/en-us/home/our-company/contact-us/` (rendered as a pill-button with green border)
7. Search input (STUBBED — icon + placeholder render for layout only, no submit handler)
8. Language switcher — `EN-US` with globe icon (STUBBED — renders the label only, no dropdown)

## Main nav (desktop, below utility bar)
8 top-level items in order. All dropdowns open via both hover and click. Only one dropdown open at a time. Panel is full-width of the 1280px container, dark green (`#005145`), absolutely positioned below the nav bar.

### Panel anatomy (universal)
- Width: **1280px** (= inner container width), aligned with the nav bar
- Layout: flex row with 40px gap between subgroup columns
- Panel background: `#005145` (dark green)
- Header region: dropdown's title link in green (matches `header` key below) rendered as a large H2 with an arrow `→` suffix
- Body: N subgroup columns, each column is its own vertical stack
- Bottom callout row (ocean-green band, darker than panel, full-width): 0–5 icon-button links, evenly distributed
- Row types used across the site (enumerated up front so the renderer is stable):
  - **secondary-title** — linked subgroup heading (green color, arrow `→` suffix)
  - **heading-static** — non-clickable subgroup heading (same style but no link/arrow; used by HIT)
  - **subtitle** — regular link under a heading (white text)
  - **description** — paragraph of body text, used in place of a list (Resources / Education / Our company)
- No row types exist on the live site beyond these four.

## Desktop behaviors (must match live)
- **Click-only** — dropdowns open on click, NOT on hover. Hover alone does nothing.
- Click top-level trigger → opens dropdown. Second click on same trigger → closes it.
- Only one dropdown open at a time; clicking a different trigger closes the previous and opens the new one.
- Escape → closes any open dropdown.
- Outside click (mousedown outside nav root) → closes the dropdown.
- `aria-haspopup="menu"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `role="menu"`, `role="menuitem"` on the right nodes.
- Tab reaches each top-level trigger; Enter / Space toggles.

## Mobile behaviors (viewport < 1024px)
- Hamburger appears top-right, logo left. Layout is a single white bar (~56px tall) with a full-width Search input stub below it.
- Search input row is rendered but not wired up (STUBBED).
- Tapping hamburger opens a full-viewport dark-green drawer listing all 8 top-level items vertically.
- Each expandable top-level item shows a right chevron; tapping opens a sub-panel that shows its columns flattened into a vertical list (heading-link followed by the column's children, separated by spacing).
- `Patients & consumers` has no chevron (direct link).
- Below the 8 top-level items, the mobile drawer shows the utility strip inline: Investors, Careers, Partner Portal login, Contact us, EN-US.
- Drawer close triggers: tap X icon, Escape key, tap a navigable link.
- While drawer is open: `document.body.style.overflow === "hidden"` (no background scroll). On close, focus returns to the hamburger button.

## Computed styles — container
- Overall header height (desktop, both bars): 130px.
- Main nav bar: white background, 48px tall, 1280px inner max-width, centered.
- Utility bar: white background, rendered inline with main nav rather than a separate strip (logo + utility + nav stack vertically in the live DOM).
- Border-bottom on header: `1px solid #6E6E6E` (thin gray hairline at the bottom of the whole header).
- Body font-family (scope default): `"Solve Pro", "Neue Haas Grotesk Text", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif`.
- Body text color: `#303030`.
- Brand green (primary): `#00A053` (approx — used for links + accents).
- Brand dark green (dropdown background): `#005145` (rgb(0, 81, 69)).
- Brand ocean-green callout strip background: ~`#006A52` (slightly lighter, within dropdown).
- Button pill border color: `#00A053`.

## Known omissions (stubbed, not implemented)
- Search input (desktop + mobile) — renders markup (input + magnifying-glass icon) for layout, no submit handler.
- Language switcher (`EN-US` globe button) — renders as a static label with a globe icon; no country picker modal.
- Login link — real href preserved, but any logged-in state (account chip, avatar) is not implemented.
- Cookie banner / consent modal — not in scope.
- Scene7 dpr/timestamp query params on the logo URL are preserved verbatim.
